      institution: Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore
      year: May '24 - July '24
      description:
        - Worked on generative methods for adding custom textures to 3D representations of common objects without using 3D editing software
        - Analyzed 3D representations such as 2D/3D Gaussian Splatting, prioritizing usability for texture transfer on standard 3D benchmarks
        - Used Huggingface Diffusers for Stable Diffusion-based editing to enhance consistency of added textures from multiple view angles

      year: May '23 - Jul '23
      description:
        - Worked on visualization approaches to enhance the interpretability of visual machine learning models for image-based search tasks
        - Benchmarked SOTA CNN and Transformer networks for quality of heatmap visualizations, explored usability as noisy object detections
        - Implemented novel loss function using image representation similarity and overlap of visualizations with ground truth detection labels
        - Enhanced average Recall@1 scores from 75.4% to 77.2%, Recall@4 scores from 78.6% to 79.8% across image search benchmarks
