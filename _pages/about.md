I am a final-year Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) student at [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm currently working with [Prof. Somak Aditya](https://adityasomak.github.io/#about) in the [Tr^2AIL Lab](https://adityasomak.github.io/research/) on Multimodal reasoning in Videos as part of my Master's Thesis project. My interests lie in Software Development and Machine Learning, particularly exploring technologies like large multimodal models, LLMs, and diffusion models. I’m also curious about how these technologies can be aligned with human interests in a safe and unbiased way, ensuring they benefit everyone and contribute to improving lives.

I'm currently an Undergraduate Safety Researcher Intern at [Enkrypt AI](https://www.enkryptai.com/), working on Red Teaming of Multimodal models. Previously, I was a summer intern at the [Vision and AI Lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/index.html), [Department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS)](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/) at [IISc Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/), working with [Prof. R. Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/) on 3D Vision and generative Diffusion Models. I was also fortunate to work with [Prof. Eric Granger](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/study-at-ets/professors/egranger) at the [LIVIA Lab](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/labs/livia), [École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS) Montréal](https://www.etsmtl.ca/) on interpretability of CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in image classification tasks. 

I'm always open for discussions and collaborations - feel free to reach out via email or any of my social media handles!
